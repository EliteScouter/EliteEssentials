## Feature Suggestion

**What would be a cool feature to add?**  
Tell us what you think would be awesome in EliteEssentials.  
Example: A GUI menu for viewing and teleporting to homes.

---

**What problem does this solve (if any)?**  
Is this fixing something annoying, or just making the mod better?  
Example: It would make homes easier for new players instead of typing commands.

---

**How should it work?**  
Describe how you imagine the feature working in-game.  
Example: `/homes` opens a menu showing all saved homes with clickable teleport buttons.

---

**Any extra ideas or details?**  
Add anything else that could make the feature even better.  
Example: Categories, cooldown display, icons, paging, permissions, etc.
